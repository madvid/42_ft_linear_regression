# ft_linear_regression
(42 project) This project will be your first steps into AI and Machine Learning. You're going to start with a simple, basic machine learning algorithm. You will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

## In brief:
Run `python3 fit.py -h` to print the usage.

There is 2 possible arguments for the `fit.py` program:
* `--graphic` which can take 3 values: `console`, `static` and `dynamic`.
* `--method` which can take 3 values: `gradient-descent`, `normal-equation` and `covariance`.

For the prediction.py program, there is no parameter, on can run it directly:
```bash
python3 prediction.py
```
